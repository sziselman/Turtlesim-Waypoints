# CRAZY TURTLE
Demonstration package for ME495.
This README is intentionally vague.
Figuring out how this package works and filling in the details is part of the
exercise. Replace the the blanks marked with `${ITEM}` with your answer.
Unless otherwise specified, list the command and all arguments that you passed to it.

## Setup Instructions
1. Compile the workspace by executing `catkin_make`
2. Initialize the ROS environment (i.e., set the necessary ROS environment variables) by executing `source devel/setup.bash`
3. Make sure no other ROS nodes are running prior to starting. 
3. Run the launchfile `go_crazy_turtle.launch` by executing `roslaunch crazy_turtle go_crazy_turtle.launch`
4. When running you can see a visual depiction of the ROS graph using the `rqt_graph` command.
   The ROS graph, including all topics and node labels, looks like:
   ![${The ROS Graph}](img/crazy_turtle_img)

## Runtime Information
The `launchfile` from above should be running at all times when executing these commands.
If the nodes launched from the `launchfile` are not running, you will get incorrect results.

5. Use the ROS command `rosnode list` to list all the nodes that are running.
   The output of the command looks like
   ```
   /mover
   /rosout
   /roving_turtle
   ```
6. Use the ROS command `rostopic list` to list the topics
   The output of the command looks like
   ```
   /rosout
   /rosout_agg
   /turtle1/cmd_vel
   /turtle1/color_sensor
   /turtle1/pose
   ```

7. Use the ROS command `rostopic hz /turtle1/cmd_vel` to verify that the frequency of
   the `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic is `120 Hz`

8. Use the ROS command `rosservice list` to list the services.
   The output of the command looks like
   ```
   /clear
   /kill
   /mover/get_loggers
   /mover/set_logger_level
   /reset
   /rosout/get_loggers
   /rosout/set_logger_level
   /roving_turtle/get_loggers
   /roving_turtle/set_logger_level
   /spawn
   /switch
   /turtle1/set_pen
   /turtle1/teleport_absolute
   /turtle1/teleport_relative
   ```
9. Use the ROS command `rosservice info /switch` to view information about the `/switch` service.
   The type of the `/switch` service is `${service type}` and it is offered by
   the `/mover` node.

10. Use the ROS command `rosparam list` to list the parameters that are loaded
    into the parameter server.
    The output of the command looks like
    ```
    /mover/velocity
    /rosdistro
    /roslaunch/uris/host_sherman_local__41897
    /roslaunch/uris/host_sherman_local__44463
    /rosversion
    /roving_turtle/background_b
    /roving_turtle/background_g
    /roving_turtle/background_r
    /run_id
    ```

## Package and Dependencies
11. Use the ROS command `rossrv package crazy_turtle` to list the types of services defined by `crazy_turtle`
    The output of the command looks like
    ```
    crazy_turtle/Switch
    ```
12. Use the ROS command `rospack depends crazy_turtle` to list the immediate (direct) dependencies of `crazy_turtle`
   The output of the command looks like
    ```
    catkin
    genmsg
    genpy
    cpp_common
    rostime
    roscpp_traits
    roscpp_serialization
    message_runtime
    gencpp
    geneus
    gennodejs
    genlisp
    message_generation
    rosbuild
    rosconsole
    std_msgs
    rosgraph_msgs
    xmlrpcpp
    roscpp
    rosgraph
    ros_environment
    rospack
    roslib
    rospy
    geometry_msgs
    std_srvs
    turtlesim
    ```
## Live Interaction
13. Use the ROS command `rosservice call /switch "mixer: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, theta: 0.0, linear_velocity: 0.0, angular_velocity: 0.0}"` to call the `/switch` service.
    The command returns `x: 0.0, y: 0.0` and the turtle `moves to the returned x, y position`.
    (Hint: use `rossrv info` on the type of the `/switch` service to see the parameters.
     To test the behavior, look at the code or try calling with `x = 1`, `y = 1`, once with `linear_velocity = 0` and `angular_velocity = 0` and once with these at different nonzero values.)
14. What is the value of the `/mover/velocity` parameter? `4.5`
15. What happens to the turtle's motion if you change `/mover/velocity` to 10 while the turtlesim and mover node are running? `same`
16. Use the ROS command `rosnode kill /mover` to kill the `/mover` node.
17. Use the ROS command `rosrun crazy_turtle mover cmd_vel:=/turtle1/cmd_vel` to start the `/mover` node. Be sure to
    remap `cmd_vel` to `/turtle1/cmd_vel`.
18. What happened to the turtle's velocity after relaunching `mover`? `faster`
